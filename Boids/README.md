# Boids
A boids-solver simulation. Includes interactive weight modifications for velocity matching, flock centering, and collision avoidance. Additional feature included allows for each boid's color to be dynamically updated based on its x-position to create a stylized rainbow effect. Please feel free to contact me for the source code.
