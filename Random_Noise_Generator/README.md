# Random Noise Generator
The initial purpose of this project was to apply a basic texture onto an object. The code was expanded to allow for increasing and decreasing the tiling factor of the texture which has been found to be useful for many instances including testing seams on image textures. Upon further testing, the tool has also been useful as a random noise generator. Increasing the scale factor of patterned images has been found to produce useful random noise results.
